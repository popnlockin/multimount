multimount
==========

MultiMount is a World of Warcraft add-on that will intelligently select a mount based on your surroundings. 

Most of what MultiMount does could be accomplished with regular macros using conditionals such as

* flyable
* indoors
* outdoors
* mounted
* nomounted
* swimming

The one thing that MultiMount provides on-top is the implied conditional that splits 'swimming' into 

* swimming under water
* bobbing at the surface

This allows you to make use of aquatic mounts easily, but when it's time to get out of the water
you can rise to the surface and summon a flyable mount to get out of the water.
